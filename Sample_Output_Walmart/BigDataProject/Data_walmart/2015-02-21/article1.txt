abstract:Editorial holds wage increases announced by Walmart, while step in right direction, are still inadequate to improve lot of low-wage workers; contends government action, including improvement of labor standards and raising of federal minimum wage, is needed to improve wages in meaningful way; says Pres Obama may need to act unilaterally in order to achieve this.
