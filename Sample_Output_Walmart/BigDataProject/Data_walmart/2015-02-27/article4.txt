lead_paragraph:Convicts released after the state eased its three-strikes law in 2012 have returned to crime at a remarkably low rate.
abstract:More than 2,000 former inmates released from prison following 2012 changes in California's three-strikes law have returned to crime at remarkably low rate; law had mandated minimum 25 years sentence for third felony offense, and which contributed significantly to overcrowding of state's prison system; experts attribute low rate of recidivism to aging and effects of extensive aid and counseling.
