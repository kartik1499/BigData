abstract:American working-class families and retirees are substantially benefiting from falling oil prices, with typical household saving $750 in 2016 due to lower gasoline prices; people who use home heating oil and propane will save an additional $750 over winter; oil prices are especially crucial for Maine residents, where two-thirds of population rely on heating oil.
