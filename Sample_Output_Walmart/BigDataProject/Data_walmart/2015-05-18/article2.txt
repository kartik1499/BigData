abstract:Decline of Galesburg, Ill, illustrates potentially stark repercussions of globalization as Pres Obama presses Trans-Pacific Partnership and other trade deals; town's population and median income has shrunk dramatically since 1999, reflecting economic recession and closure of Maytag factory that was its largest employer; trend highlights mounting evidence that free trade tends to benefit upper-income households disproportionately, leaving places like Galesburg to reckon with costs.
