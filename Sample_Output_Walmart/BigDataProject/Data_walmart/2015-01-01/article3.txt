abstract:Minimum wage increases are set to take effect in 20 states, pushing number of states that exceed $7.25 federal minimum to 29; changes will affect some 60 percent of nation's work force, though difference will only be marginal in several states; battle to increase minimum wage has grown more intense amid rising income inequality, prompting Pres Obama to propose a new federal standard of $10.10 per hour.
