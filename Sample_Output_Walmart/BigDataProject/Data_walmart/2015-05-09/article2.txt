abstract:Gail Collins Op-Ed column submits that Utah, while heavily Republican and pro-gun, is far less concerned than Texas about military exercise known as Jade Helm 15 scheduled to be carried out in Southwest; notes Texas leaders and residents claim exercise is cover for government plot to take over area and confiscate residents' guns; says small percentage of both American public and leadership have always been crazy, but in contemporary political climate Texas' saner conservatives are loath to disagree with them.
