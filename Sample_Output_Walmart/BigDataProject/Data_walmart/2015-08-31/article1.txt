lead_paragraph:The sale of “modern sporting rifles” is a thinly disguised campaign to put even more military-style weapons in civilian hands.
abstract:Editorial offers qualified praise for Walmart's decision to stop selling AR-15 semiautomatic assault rifle and full range of similar assault weapons; contends that, despite Walmart's decision, it is a certainty that gun manufacturing industry and National Rifle Assn will continue to support marketing of civilian firearms that are essentially variations of potent battlefield weapons.
