abstract:Editorial calls for big corporations who are serious about civil rights to cease funding campaigns of lawmakers who back legislation that discriminates against gays and lesbians, rather than merely issuing corporate statements against such laws; suggests businesses could, as additional step, ask lawmakers to pass anti-discrimination protections for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, using their vast influence in service of equality.
