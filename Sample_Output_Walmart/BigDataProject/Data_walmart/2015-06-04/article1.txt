abstract:Walmart, by agreeing to raise average store temperatures by 1 degree for most of its locations, is hoping to be viewed as a more caring employer; company is also raising starting wage for over 100,000 managers in United States, following February raise for half-million entry-level workers; efforts at increasing employee satisfaction are due in part to rising competition from reviving job market.
