abstract:Labor Dept reports employers increased payrolls by 295,000 jobs in February, briging unemployment rate down to 5.5 percent, but that wages continue to lag and rose only 0.1 percent for private-sector workers; report spurs new round of optimism despite wage numbers and speculation that Federal Reserve may raise interest rates earlier rather than later.
