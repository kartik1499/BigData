abstract:Departure of Richard W Fisher from Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, where he has been president for a decade, marks loss of one of the most vocal opponents of Fed's stimulus campaign even as that campaign comes to end; Fisher was known for eloquent arguments that were often more colorful than any of those of his colleagues, and often angered those who believed Fed should do more to help unemployed.
