lead_paragraph:Facing a tighter job market, employee turnover and scrutiny of its labor practices, the retailer plans to increase pay for a half-million workers.
abstract:Walmart says it will raise wages for half-million of its employees to minimum of $9 per hour by April and at least $10 by February 2016; changes come as company faces scrutiny for its labor practices, and as much-improved job market has made it difficult for them to maintain high rate of employee turnover; labor advocates say increase is insufficient.
